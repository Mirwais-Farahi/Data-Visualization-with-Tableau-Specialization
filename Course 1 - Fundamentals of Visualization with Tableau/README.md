## What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization (or data viz) is the process of communicating numerical or quantitative information through visual means. This involves using various mediums such as charts, graphs, maps, images, and icons to convey data in a format that is easy to understand. The medium used for data visualization can range from print, interactive web pages, static infographics, to even unconventional forms like modeling clay or interpretive dance.

## Why Do We Do It?

We use data visualization to make complex data more accessible, understandable, and actionable. By presenting data visually, we can highlight trends, patterns, and insights that may be difficult to grasp from raw data alone. Effective data visualization helps in decision-making and communicating information in a clear, engaging manner.

### Key Takeaways

- **Data visualization** uses visual elements to represent data.
- **Mediums** include charts, maps, infographics, and more.
- It helps to **simplify complex data** and **highlight trends**.
- The goal is to make data **understandable** and **actionable**.

## How Do We Make a Data Visualization?

In this lesson, we explore the skills and mindset needed to create a successful data visualization. The exercise you did with Google Sheets was designed to help you recognize foundational skills, which you can later apply in more advanced tools like Tableau.

### Key Skills in Data Visualization

#### 1. **Patience**
   - Learning new tools takes time. Be patient with yourself, especially when transitioning between different software. Mastery of one tool doesn’t always directly translate to others.
   - Think of it like learning a new language—start from the basics and progress slowly.

#### 2. **Critical Thinking**
   - When things don’t work as expected, it’s essential to analyze the situation and think about your goal.
   - Explore the available tools and options carefully, and don’t hesitate to consult resources when needed.

#### 3. **Flexibility and Creativity**
   - Visualization tools may not always offer exactly what you want, so flexibility and creativity are key.
   - If one approach doesn’t work, try different solutions or adjust your expectations to achieve the desired effect.
   - Be prepared to “trick” the tool into doing what you need, as long as it’s functional and effective.

#### 4. **Deciding When It's Done**
   - It’s important to know when to stop tweaking your visualization. Perfection isn’t always necessary.
   - Focus on what matters most to the end-user. If the feature doesn’t affect their experience, it might not need further adjustments.
   - Don’t aim for perfect, aim for effective—sometimes a "flawed" visualization is better than overcomplicating it.

### Conclusion

Creating a data visualization involves a mix of patience, critical thinking, flexibility, creativity, and knowing when to move on. These skills will help you not only work with tools like Google Sheets or Tableau but also develop a mindset that enhances your ability to communicate through data effectively.

3. **Refining the Date Field**:
   - Since the data only contains the first of the month, remove the day pill from the view by clicking the minus sign or dragging it off the shelf.
   
4. **Drag the Measure to Rows**:
   - Drag **Number of Records** (or the relevant metric) to the **Rows** shelf. This will populate the y-axis of the chart.

5. **Create the Line Chart**:
   - Tableau will automatically create a line chart as it recognizes you're working with time-trended data.

6. **Adjust the Fit of the Chart**:
   - To remove any unwanted scroll bars or white space, adjust the fit from **Standard** to **Entire View** using the drop-down at the top.

7. **Format the X-Axis**:
   - Right-click on any month on the x-axis and select **Format**.
   - In the formatting pane, change the **Dates** drop-down from **Automatic** to **First Letter** to clean up the axis labels.

8. **Analyze the Trends**:
   - Review the line chart to see if the number of injuries is trending upward or downward over time.

9. **Seasonality Check**:
   - Drag the **Year** from the **Columns** shelf to the **Detail** button on the **Marks Card** to assess seasonality.
   - You can also switch the **Month** pill to **Quarter** to get a better view of seasonal trends.

10. **Rename and Duplicate Sheets**:
    - Rename your sheet to "Incidents Over Time".
    - Duplicate the sheet and create a new version that focuses on the seasonality trend.

## More Data Exploration: Make a Treemap

In this lesson, we will dive deeper into data exploration by creating a **Treemap**. Treemaps are especially useful when you have many categories and need to explore how different categories relate to a measure. We will explore the remaining patterns in our dataset by visualizing multiple dimensions and one measure using a Treemap.

### Learning Outcomes:
- **Data Exploration with Treemaps**: Use Treemaps to uncover additional insights from a dataset with multiple dimensions.

### Steps to Create a Treemap:

1. **Open a New Sheet**:
   - Start by opening a new worksheet in Tableau.

2. **Consult the Show Me Menu**:
   - Go to the **Show Me** menu and select the **Treemap** chart type. It suggests one or more dimensions and measures. In this case, we’ll be using one measure and multiple dimensions.

3. **Drag Dimensions to the View**:
   - Select all of the dimensions except for **Date** and **Year** and drag them onto the view. This includes dimensions like **Victim Sex**, **Injury Result Description**, and others.
   
4. **Drag Measure to the View**:
   - Drag **Number of Records** (or the relevant measure) to the **Color** or **Size** field on the Marks card.

5. **Apply the Treemap Visualization**:
   - After dragging the dimensions and measure, Tableau will automatically create a Treemap. You’ll notice the Treemap button in the Show Me menu lights up.

6. **Adjust the View**:
   - To optimize the view, move the **Color Legend** below the Marks card and change the **Fit** option to **Entire View**. This will ensure the Treemap fits within the available space and displays more clearly.

7. **Explore the Data**:
   - Take a look at the different categories that Tableau has visualized. For example, you can see how the data breaks down by **Victim Sex** and **Injury Result Description**.
   - Rearranging dimensions in the Marks card (e.g., placing **Borough** at the top) can change the way the Treemap is organized. You can edit the **Tooltip** to reorder the dimensions if necessary.

8. **Interpret the Results**:
   - Look for patterns, such as the distribution of injuries across different victim categories, boroughs, and injury types.

9. **Rename the Sheet**:
   - Rename the sheet to **Incident Treemap** to reflect the data exploration you have performed.

While this isn't an exhaustive list, here are five key tips to keep in mind as you work on your data visualizations.

### Best Practices:

#### 1. **Know Your Audience**
   - Understand who you're creating the visualization for and what they need to see. Executives, for example, want quick and efficient insights, while product managers may need more detailed data to explore. 
   - Be specific about the questions being asked and push back when you get vague requests. Knowing the exact goal will help you design the best visualization.

#### 2. **Know Your Data**
   - Familiarize yourself with the data you’re working with: how it was collected, cleaned, and processed.
   - Look for missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in your dataset, and understand the "grain" of the data—what each row represents.
   - Being thorough with your data is crucial, as errors in your analysis can quickly damage your credibility.

#### 3. **Use Color Purposefully**
   - Avoid overloading your visualization with too many colors. Start with basic gray and add color only where necessary.
   - Limit your color palette to about five colors. If you're using color to distinguish between items, ensure that the same color isn't used for two different things within the same visualization.
   - Be mindful of color blindness, particularly red-green colorblindness. Consider using different brightness levels, or incorporating shapes and labels to provide additional cues.

#### 4. **Less is More: Simplicity is Key**
   - Keep your visualizations clean and simple. Avoid cluttering the dashboard with unnecessary numbers or decorations. 
   - Minimize the use of grid lines, axis labels, and text. Allow your data to be the main focus by reducing distractions.
   - Use white space strategically to separate elements and give the data room to breathe, making it easier for your audience to focus.

#### 5. **Get Feedback Early and Often**
   - Don’t wait until you’ve spent days refining your visualization before seeking feedback. The earlier you gather input, the better.
   - Regularly check in with stakeholders to make sure you’re on the right track and not working on the wrong things.
   - Familiarity with your data can make it hard to see things from your audience's perspective, so frequent feedback helps keep you aligned with their needs.

### Recap:
To create great data visualizations, remember:
- **Know your audience**
- **Know your data**
- **Use color purposefully**
- **Less is more**
- **Get feedback early and often**

By following these best practices, you’ll be well on your way to mastering data visualization and delivering impactful insights.

- **Getting Started with Tableau**: 
  You got hands-on with Tableau, learning about its components and features. You created three different types of visualizations—each offering a unique perspective on your data—and combined them into your very first dashboard.
  
- **Building Your Portfolio**: 
  We discussed how to stay involved in the Tableau community, how to get feedback, and how to build a portfolio by participating in community projects such as Makeover Monday. 

- **Best Practices for Visualization**: 
  You learned important best practices for data visualization, including knowing your audience, understanding your data, using color effectively, and keeping visualizations simple and clean.

### What’s Next:

This course gave you a solid foundation, but there’s much more to learn! To deepen your knowledge and refine your skills, I encourage you to move on to the next course in the specialization. You'll learn the theory behind effective design and how to make visualizations tailored to specific audiences. The following courses will use the full version of **Tableau Desktop**, which provides more advanced tools and features for creating sophisticated visualizations.

Good luck on your journey to becoming a data visualization expert, and keep practicing to stay sharp!

Happy vizing!
